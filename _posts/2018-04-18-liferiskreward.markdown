I can't help but stop thinking life as a risk reward game. Achieving anything great in life requires substantial risk whether fame, money or success.

Many sportsman who excel in their field risk considerable physical injuries to attain that level of wealth, fame and success. Many think that becoming a sportsperson is a path to becoming rich. Its highly untrue. Unless you reach the pinnacle i.e. international level (which by no means is a small feat), don't even dream of becoming rich playing state or even national level sports. National level sportsman are payed far below their international counterparts. It is also worth noting that a sportperson might play at max 10-15 yrs before taking retirement. Hence their earning potential is maximized in this period.

Moving away from sports, What about enterpreneurs who run companies? What's their risk? Just like sportsperson carry physical injuries, enterpreneurship risk mental injuries. This might be a surprise for many, but its the unsaid truth of enterpreneurship know between fellow enterpreneurs only. Check out the following links:

Not just that, 90% of startups end up in failure, that means earning potential during that period is lost for an enterpreneur.

So, the next time you are thinking of achieving great success without paying any price or taking any big risk. Stop right there. 

PS: Exceptions are always there.
